<h1>The Game Tracker ðŸŽ² </h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
This is a code written in java for a program that keeps track of a multi-player game. At the beginning of the program, the user is asked to input information regarding the game that they wish to track. They are asked for the game's name, the names of each player, and the number of rounds. The user is then instructed that for each round they must input the player(s)' name and the number of points they gain during the round. The user is to do this for every round of the game. After the final round, the program calculates the player(s) with the most points and announces them as the winner. This code would serve as the backend for a graphic user interface program and is still being worked on.
